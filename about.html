                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Carzone Bike Helmets was founded with a singular mission: to make cycling safer for everyone. What began as a small team of passionate cyclists and safety engineers has grown into a leading manufacturer of premium bicycle helmets trusted by riders around the world.</p>
                
                <p>Our journey started when our founders, avid cyclists themselves, recognized a gap in the market for high-quality, affordable bike helmets that didn't compromise on safety or style. They witnessed too many fellow cyclists riding without proper protection, often because quality helmets were too expensive or uncomfortable to wear consistently.</p>
                
                <p>Driven by this vision, we set out to create helmets that cyclists would actually want to wear‚Äîcombining cutting-edge safety technology with comfortable designs and attractive aesthetics, all at accessible price points. Today, Carzone Bike Helmets protects millions of cyclists across the globe, from professional racers to weekend warriors to daily commuters.</p>
